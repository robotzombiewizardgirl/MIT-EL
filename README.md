# MIT-EL
A free software license based on the MIT/X11 license with extra text to prohibit (some) unethical use.

## What does this license do?
It allows you to:

 - Share software licensed under it with anyone
 - Modify the software to suit your needs
 - Share your modified copies
 - Sell the software
 
As long as you:

 - Aren't a fascist
 - Don't use it for anything involving a neural network (commonly misnomered as "artificial intelligence")
 - Provide the license and original copyright notices with the software
 
Unlike the original MIT / X11 license, this license doesn't allow you to sublicense or change the license of the software.

## Why does this license exist?
There  are plenty of poorly written, unenforceable variants of the MIT license out there. Often they aren't even licenses anymore because of how much they've been screwed with. "Antifascist" MIT licenses are one of the more common types; they're also usually the worst at being actual licenses. This license exists to act as an enforceable license that provides that same utility, while also remaining free (for humans to use). 

It also attempts to prevent circumvention by making the software's inclusion in "AI" datasets against the rules.

## Is it actually free (per the FSF definition)?
Yes. This license furnishes you with all the rights required by the FSF:

0. You may run the program as you wish for any purpose provided the license is applicable to you
1. You can read the source code, and study how the program works; you can modify it however you like provided you are human
2. You can redistribute the software however you like
3. You can redistribute your modified copies

The FSF does not define who the "recipient" of a license is, only that these rights are granted to them. Fascists and neural networks are not allowable recipients of the software, and thus this license is compliant with the FSF definition.

If you have a problem with this assessment I invite you to find a very large rock and eat it as practice for swallowing hard truths.

## Why does this license not allow sublicensing?
Theoretically, one could remove or work around the added requirements and make this variant useless. I also think allowing additonal restrictions through sublicensing is very anti-freedom.

## Can I pay you to get a version of your stuff without the extra clauses?
No. Please consider suicide as a course of treatment for your profound idiocy.
