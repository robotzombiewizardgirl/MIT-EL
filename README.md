# MIT-EL
A free software license based on the MIT/X11 license with extra text to prohibit (some) unethical use.

## What does this license do?
It allows you to:

 - Share software licensed under it with anyone
 - Modify the software to suit your needs
 - Share your modified copies
 - Sell the software
 
As long as you:

 - Aren't a fascist
 - Don't use it for anything involving a neural network (commonly misnomered as "artificial intelligence")
 - Provide the license and original copyright notices with the software
 
Unlike the original MIT / X11 license, this license doesn't allow you to sublicense or change the license of the software.

## Why does this license exist?
There  are plenty of poorly written, unenforceable variants of the MIT license out there. Often they aren't even licenses anymore because of how much they've been screwed with. "Antifascist" MIT licenses are one of the more common types; they're also usually the worst at being actual licenses. This license exists to act as an enforceable license that provides that same utility, while also remaining free (for humans to use). 

It also attempts to prevent circumvention by making the software's inclusion in "AI" datasets against the rules.

## Why does this license not allow sublicensing?
Theoretically, one could remove the added requirements and make this variant useless. I also think allowing additonal restrictions through sublicensing is very anti-freedom.

## Can I pay you to get a version of your stuff without the extra clauses?
No. Please consider suicide as a course of treatment for your profound idiocy.
