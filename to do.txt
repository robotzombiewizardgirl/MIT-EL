the motivation for basing this license on the MIT (X11) license in particular is because that license is relatively simple and very free.
instead of starting with an overcomplicated predatory license that might be slightly more copyleft and attempting to work all its' issues out, 
I started with the MIT license and am slowly making it more copyleft (e.g. removing right to sublicense). eventually this work will become 
completely separate to the MIT license and at that point I will rename it, probably to

> The RobotZombie Public License (RZPL)

because it sounds cool and has four letters. I might also end up making it noncompliant with the FSF definition of "free" software, because
allowing software to be used in malware is bad and reduces the overall freedom in the world. that's ages away though.
